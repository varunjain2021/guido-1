# 🧪 Phase 2 Testing Guide: Location Tools MCP Migration

## 🎯 **Testing Objectives**
1. Verify location tools work via MCP
2. Confirm fallback to legacy on errors
3. Check performance and voice quality
4. Validate feature flag controls

---

## 📱 **Setup: Enable MCP for Location Tools**

Add this to your app (temporarily in `RealtimeConversationView` or main view):

```swift
// Add this button to your UI for testing
Button("🧪 Enable MCP Location Testing") {
    Task { @MainActor in
        // Enable hybrid mode with location tools
        FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .hybrid
        FeatureFlags.shared.enableMCPForCategory(.location)
        FeatureFlags.shared.debugLoggingEnabled = true
        FeatureFlags.shared.isPerformanceMonitoringEnabled = true
        
        print("✅ TESTING: Enabled MCP for location tools")
        print("📊 TESTING: Performance monitoring enabled")
        print("🔍 TESTING: Debug logging enabled")
    }
}
```

## 🗣️ **Test 1: Basic Location Tools (MCP)**

### **Test Commands:**
```
👤 "Where am I?"
👤 "What's my current location?"
👤 "Tell me about my location"
```

### **Expected MCP Logs:**
```
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: get_user_location
✅ [LocationMCPServer] Found user location
🔧 [MCPToolCoordinator] Executing 'get_user_location' via MCP
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI responds with your current location
- ✅ Logs show MCP routing (not legacy)
- ✅ Response time similar to before
- ✅ Voice quality unchanged

## 🍕 **Test 2: Restaurant Search (MCP)**

### **Test Commands:**
```
👤 "Find restaurants near me"
👤 "Find Italian restaurants nearby"
👤 "Show me Chinese food options"
👤 "Where can I get sushi?"
```

### **Expected MCP Logs:**
```
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: find_nearby_restaurants

🔧 [MCPToolCoordinator] Executing 'find_nearby_restaurants' via MCP
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI lists restaurants with details
- ✅ Cuisine filtering works (Italian, Chinese, etc.)
- ✅ Includes distance and ratings
- ✅ MCP logs visible

---

## 🚌 **Test 3: Transportation Search (MCP)**

### **Test Commands:**
```
👤 "Find bus stops near me"
👤 "Where's the nearest train station?"
👤 "Find bike sharing stations"
👤 "Show me taxi stands nearby"
```

### **Expected MCP Logs:**
```
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: find_nearby_transport
✅ [LocationMCPServer] Found 2 transport options
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AI lists transport options
- ✅ Shows different types (bus, train, bike)
- ✅ Includes routes/availability info

---

## 🏛️ **Test 4: Landmarks & Services (MCP)**

### **Test Commands:**
```
👤 "Find museums near me"
👤 "Show me parks nearby"
👤 "Where's the nearest hospital?"
👤 "Find pharmacies around here"
```

### **Expected MCP Logs:**
```
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: find_nearby_landmarks
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: find_nearby_services
✅ [LocationMCPServer] Found 2 landmarks
✅ [LocationMCPServer] Found 3 services
```

---

## 🧭 **Test 5: Directions (MCP)**

### **Test Commands:**
```
👤 "How do I get to Central Park?"
👤 "Give me walking directions to the nearest Starbucks"
👤 "Driving directions to the airport"
```

### **Expected MCP Logs:**
```
🗺️ [LocationMCPServer] Executing tool: get_directions
✅ [LocationMCPServer] Generated directions to Central Park
```

---

## 🔄 **Test 6: Fallback to Legacy**

### **Setup: Simulate MCP Failure**
Add this test button:

```swift
Button("🚨 Test MCP Fallback") {
    Task { @MainActor in
        // Temporarily break MCP connection to test fallback
        print("🧪 TESTING: Simulating MCP failure...")
        
        // Force emergency rollback
        FeatureFlags.shared.emergencyRollbackToLegacy(reason: "Testing fallback mechanism")
        
        print("🔄 TESTING: Should now use legacy system")
    }
}
```

### **Test Commands After Fallback:**
```
👤 "Where am I?" (should work via legacy)
👤 "Find restaurants near me" (should work via legacy)
```

### **Expected Fallback Logs:**
```
🚨 [FeatureFlags] EMERGENCY ROLLBACK: Testing fallback mechanism
🔧 [MCPToolCoordinator] Executing 'get_user_location' via Legacy
✅ All tools now using legacy system
```

---

## ⚡ **Test 7: Performance Comparison**

### **Performance Test Script:**
```swift
Button("📊 Performance Test") {
    Task { @MainActor in
        // Test MCP performance
        FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .hybrid
        FeatureFlags.shared.enableMCPForCategory(.location)
        
        let startTime = Date()
        // Voice command: "Where am I?"
        // Record response time
        
        // Then test legacy
        FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .legacy
        
        let legacyStartTime = Date()
        // Voice command: "Where am I?"
        // Compare response times
        
        print("📊 TESTING: Compare MCP vs Legacy response times")
    }
}
```

### **Performance Commands:**
```
👤 "Where am I?" (repeat 3 times for MCP)
// Switch to legacy mode
👤 "Where am I?" (repeat 3 times for legacy)
```

### **Performance Metrics to Check:**
- Response time (should be similar ±200ms)
- Memory usage (should be stable)
- Audio quality (should be identical)
- Transcription accuracy (should be unchanged)

---

## 🔍 **Test 8: Feature Flag Controls**

### **Test All Migration States:**

```swift
// Test Legacy Mode
FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .legacy
// Voice test: "Where am I?" → Should use RealtimeToolManager

// Test Hybrid Mode (Location only)
FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .hybrid
FeatureFlags.shared.enableMCPForCategory(.location)
// Voice test: "Where am I?" → Should use MCP
// Voice test: "What's the weather?" → Should use Legacy (not location)

// Test MCP with Fallback
FeatureFlags.shared.migrationState = .mcpWithFallback
// Voice test: All tools attempt MCP first, fallback on error
```

- [ ] Multi-turn conversations work
- [ ] Echo cancellation still works

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Rollback**

If ANY test fails or voice quality degrades:

```swift
// IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
FeatureFlags.shared.emergencyRollbackToLegacy(reason: "Testing revealed issues")
```

This instantly reverts ALL tools to the legacy system.

```

### **Red Flags (Stop Testing):**
```
❌ Voice audio becomes choppy
❌ Response time > 2x legacy
❌ Transcription accuracy drops
❌ Multi-turn conversations break
❌ App crashes or freezes
```
